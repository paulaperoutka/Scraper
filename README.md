## Motivation

Visit Cheery Scraper to scrape Lonely Planet's travel website for articles, read & visit articles about travel destinations across the globe, save favorite articles, and comment for others to read!

## Instructions
When a user visits Cheery Scraper, the app shows already-scraped stories from Lonely Planet. <br />
Users can also scrape new articles. <br />
Each scraped article can be saved to a database using mongoose's ORM.  Title, summary, image, and URL are all saved into the database, in addition to editable user comments saved to a partnered table in the mongo database. 

## Credits

Thank you to Lonely Planet for amazing articles!
